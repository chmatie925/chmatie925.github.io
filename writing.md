<h2>Ottoman Simmons</h2>
<p>Ottoman Simmons has never played with a dog. He’s never ridden a bus or bought a soda from a vending machine. In fact, he’s never left the grounds of the retirement home where he was born. In the heavy summer heat, the edges of his lifelong routine begin to fray as the relationships that have defined his world unravel.</p>

<p><i>Ottoman Simmons is a novel-length manuscript.</i></p>
